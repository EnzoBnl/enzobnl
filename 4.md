# 4. Conclusion
I hope that this last section convinced you that the use of *flexible-memoization* can be considered as an elegant way to solve the problematic that motivated this work. I think that the strengths of the library are that it can deal with any input function, that its API provides simple yet powerful way to customize caching behaviors and expand them, and that the choices of implementation and technologies are as versatile as possible.

I really enjoyed spending time in this master's thesis, inspecting Spark's plans, digging into sources, touring literature and designing a solution that took an unexpected shape. I also hope that this can be felt through what I just wrote.
